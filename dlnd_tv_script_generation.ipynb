    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "At my first submission, I was getting lot of 'out memory runtime errors' if I use higher batch size/embedding dimensions etc. Thanks to the reviewer, I realized that I was passing the wrong vocabulary size (= len(int_text) of 1 million instead of ~20K) which resulted in frequent crashes and added to my frustration. Finally, I am able to use higher batch size, embedding dimension, hidden dimension and experiment with learning rate to meet the expectations. Following are my comments on the hyperparameters: <br>\n",
    "**Embedding dimension:** Embedding dimension is used to convert the word to vector representation which behaves as a lookup table. As in character generation assignment the recommended size was 300, it should be at least this size to capture the context around the word. I have used 512. <br>\n",
    "**Hidded Dimension:** I have tried 256. The higher this dimension, the more insights the model will learn from the data. But it has a trade-off with training performance and size of vocabulary.<br>\n",
    "**Learning rate:** I did experiment with learning rate and realized that at a smaller learning rate of 0.0001, the convergence was too slow and at a higher learning rate of 0.01, the convergence was initially fast but it would not reduce to loss to lower than 6.5 or 7 <br>\n",
    "**Number of layers:** With 1 layer the loss will remain higher given the size of vocabulary and combinations of words. With higher layers the training process was extremely slow, so I kept this hyperparameter at 2. <br>\n",
    "**Sequence Length:** Higher sequence length means more context to learn. \n"
